  "aboutAppContent": "The STAR app is a screening application to measure skeletal muscle aging that reduces muscle strength and function. Sarcopenia diagnosis is still rare and relatively difficult to perform, hence the SARC-F questionnaire was developed to detect Sarcopenia early with speed and high specificity, and can be used for Sarcopenia diagnostics without requiring other specific measurement tools. The SARC-F questionnaire consists of five questions covering muscle strength, walking ability, ability to get up from a chair, ability to climb stairs, and risk of falling.",
